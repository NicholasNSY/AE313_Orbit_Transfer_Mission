# Orbit Transfer Mission from LEO to GEO

**Koreasat-5A Launch Program - AGI STK**
- **__Status__**: :+1:
  - Following the effective launch of the Falcon 9, SpaceX has successfully stationed the Koreasat-5A into a circular LEO parking orbit.
  - The main objective of this project is to understand how a payload is delivered to an orbit oriented on a different inclination angle from the starting orbit. 
  - This report discusses possible plane change maneuvers to transfer the payload from the parking orbit to a circular GEO. 
  - The bi-elliptical transfer with split-plane change and the Hohmann split-plane change maneuver are the two methods to be used for this analysis.
  - However, as propellant fuel is limited, we will demonstrate the "optimal" plane change trajectory for the case of this mission.
